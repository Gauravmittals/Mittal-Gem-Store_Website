                                    <p>Cat’s eye stone also known as Lehsuniya or Vaidurya / Vaidoorya/ Vaiduryam, belongs to the chrysoberyl mineral family. This masterpiece shows a brilliant effect known as Chatoyancy due to which a vertical slit can be seen at the surface making it look like the eye of a cat, hence the name.

                                        In the Astrological world, the gem holds immense value because it is related to the planet Ketu, which is a shadow planet. It eliminates the malefic effects of Ketu, so people who are suffering from distress due to Ketu’s negative position should wear an original cat’s eye stone. It will bring happiness, peace and balance as well as will ward off evil and protect the wearer from negative energies.
                                        
                                        The price of cat’s eye or Lehsunia stone price starts from INR 500 to INR 3,00,000. The cost depends upon the 4C's, namely carat, colour, cut, and clarity.</p>

A glistening choice made entirely from the element carbon, diamonds reveal a symphonic beauty when light hits, creating a spectacle within its facets. Symbolizing wisdom, purity, and clarity, the Natural Diamond (Heera stone) is a powerful gemstone popular in the near-colorless variety. Being one of the hardest minerals known to man, some of the first and most iconic diamonds were mined in Golconda, India. The diamond stone is also known as Heera, Vajra, Heeram, etc.



                                        Diamonds are the best stones because of their extreme hardness, brightness, and sparkle. The diamond stone is an April birthstone and symbolizes enduring love in gemstone symbolism. Diamonds are measured in carats, which equal 200 milligrams, and points, which equal one carat. In addition to gem-quality stones, industrial diamonds come in a variety of forms.</p>
